# Frames_Json_Builder
Json file builder for [Jahir Fiquitiva's](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva) [Frames Dashboard](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Frames)
This tool could help you create json file from wallpaper folders.

## Installation

#### Dependencies

##### Windows
There is currently no native script for windows. But you can use the script with [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#2-install-wsl). (Install Ubuntu 22.04 for install exa without problem.)
```bash
sudo apt-get install nano sed exa
```

##### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install nano sed exa
```

Download code and extract archive to main wallpaper folder. It should look like the following.

```mermaid
graph TD
A(Main repo directory)
    A --> B(frames_json_builder)
    B --> I(builder)
    B --> J(Scheme)
    B --> K(file_lists)
    B --> L[script.sh]
    A --> C(wallpaper directory)
    C --> D(collection1)
    C --> E(collection2)
    D --> F(wallpaper1)
    D --> G(wallpaper2)
    E --> H(wallpaper3)
```

## Usage
Run script.sh
#### First configuration
The first time you run the script, it will check the configuration file and create it because it can't find it.
You must fill in the variables on the screen that opens.
```bash
ROOT=destination of root directory of wallpapers
USERNAME=github username
REPO=github repository name
WALLFOLDER=parent directory name of the collections
```
After fill the variables press ctrl+x and save configuration file. Wait for the script finishes. Then your wallpapers.json file will be in root folder.


#### Naming scheme
- All words must begin with a capital letter.
- Use underscores instead of spaces.
- There should be no spaces between numbers and words.
- Filenames should be in the form of "Artist_Name-Wallpaper_Name.png" (The type of extension doesn't matter.)
- For example "Osman_Onur_KOÃ‡-Material_You_Wp1.png"
